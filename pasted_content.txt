After the user finishes the reaction challenge, a form appears asking for personal details: name, mobile number, and email address. I want you to do the following enhancements using only front-end technologies (no backend or server-side scripting):
Track the fastest reaction time during the current session only. The reaction time is measured in seconds (e.g., 0.243 seconds). Use a JavaScript variable or localStorage to keep track of the best score so far.
When a user submits the form, check if their reaction time is the fastest yet.
If it is the fastest, store their name and reaction time as the current best.
Display this best name and time at the top of the screen, in a clearly visible and styled area (you can use a new #leaderboard or #highscore div at the top of the page).
Make sure the layout and design match the style used in style.css (Volvo blue background, white text, etc.).
If the next user breaks the previous record, automatically update the displayed name and time with the new champion.
The leaderboard only needs to show the single best performer (not a full list).
Do not store data on a server or use backend files. Use only JavaScript and localStorage (if needed) to persist data across page refreshes during the session.
Make sure the fastest time and name are visible on the main screen even before the next user starts the game.
Format the displayed fastest time with 3 decimal places in seconds (e.g., “0.246 seconds”).
Keep the personal detail form and reaction game flow as they are, but integrate this high-score logic smoothly into the flow."**
